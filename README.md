**Kickstarter Campaign as Smart Contract**

On kickstarter.com many projects will be active, which will raise funds from contributors to kickstart an interesting project. But, there is very less transparency, where in the idea person sometimes will misuse the contributions, without really spending on the project.

**react-solidity-kickstarter** tries to add more control and transparency to the kickstarter kind of problem using ethereum smart contracts.
* Idea person/Manager will create a Campaign
* Contributors will support the project with donations which will be credited to Campaign account on ethereum network.
* Manager will create spending requests with details about how the money will be spent along with recipient account address, who will recieve the money.
* contributors will approve the spending requests.
* Recipient will receive the money

**This is the companion repo to an Ethereum/Solidity course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/)**
